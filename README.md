# speedrun-chat-app

a _very_ (the most, maybe) simple chat app that was made just for fun, currently hosted using heroku and you can view it [here](http://speedrun-chat-app.herokuapp.com/).

## pre-requisites

- git
- php
- internet connection

## setup

open up a terminal and just type the commands below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CarterSnich/chat-app.git
cd chat-app
php -S 127.0.0.1:5555
```

no need to run a local database as it connects to a `remotemysql.com` instance
